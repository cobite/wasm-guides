Setting up your development environment.

Make sure you have everything installed:

Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Golang (Should not be needed but can be useful for working with the Cosmos SDK)

then do:

```markdown
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl

cargo install cargo-run-script
```
